    <h1>Dior makeup</h1>

    <p>
      Another fashion house with French roots, to worship in contrast to the
      already established Chanel with hyper-feminine silhouettes-pleats,
      floating fabrics and an emphasis on curves. Christian Mailer, born in
      1905, worked as a pattern cutter for Robert, and then for Lucien until
      1946, when he officially opened the Christian Couture House at 30 Obroud.
      Working for established names in fashion at the time meant Gore didn't
      have to "wait to find out" when he finally launched his brand—in fact, his
      grand opening was the long-awaited event that created a radical shift in
      fashion! The designs on display were so different from the current World
      War II fashion that the editor-in-chief of Harper's Bazaar at the time
      said, "This is quite a revolution, dear Christian! Your dresses have such
      a new look." "New Look" were two words used to describe fashion mailers
      for years afterward—the extreme emphasis on female forms in stark contrast
      to the post-war era. They brought a new lightness and joy to fashion -
      closing the chapter for good.
